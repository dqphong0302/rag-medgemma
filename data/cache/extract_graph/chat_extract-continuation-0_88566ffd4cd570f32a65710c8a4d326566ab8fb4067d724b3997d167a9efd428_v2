Between 2006 and 2013, all epileptic outpatients treated with high doses of ZNS were selected. Safety and efficacy were assessed based on patient and caregiver reports. Serum levels of ZNS and other concomitant antiepileptic drugs were evaluated if available. Nine patients (5 female): 8 focal/1 generalized pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Mean age: 34 years. Most frequent seizure type: complex partial seizures; other seizure types: generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, myoclonia. Zonisamide in polytherapy in all (100%), administered in tritherapy in 3 (33%) of 9 patients; mean dose: 633 (600-700) mg/d; efficacy (>50% seizure reduction) was observed in 5 (55%) of 9 patients. Five of 9 patients are still taking high doses of ZNS (more than 1 year). Adverse events were observed in 3 (37%) of 8 patients. Good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs had been observed in 6 (66%) of 9 patients. Plasma levels of ZNS were only available in 2 patients; both were in the therapeutic range (34.95, 30.91) (10-40 mg/L).\n\nAnswer: High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN PHARMACOREsistant EPILEPSY PATIENTS<|>PERSON<|>Patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>CHEMICAL<|>A medication used to treat epilepsy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZNS<|>CHEMICAL<|>A medication used to treat epilepsy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPILEPSY<|>EVENT<|>A neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGH DOSES OF ZNS<|>EVENT<|>High doses of ZNS are a treatment for pharmacoresistant epilepsy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2006-2013<|>TIMEFRAME<|>Time period during which the study took place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>9 PATIENTS<|>PERSON<|>Patients who were treated with high doses of ZNS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 FEMALE PATIENTS<|>PERSON<|>Female patients who were treated with high doses of ZNS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8 FOCAL/1 GENERALIZED PHARMACOREsistant EPILEPSY PATIENTS<|>PERSON<|>Patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>34 YEARS<|>AGE<|>Age of the average patient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES<|>EVENT<|>A type of seizure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OTHER SEIZURE TYPES<|>EVENT<|>Other types of seizures)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN PHARMACOREsistant EPILEPSY PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy were treated with ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIGH DOSES OF ZNS<|>EPILEPSY<|>High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>9 PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Patients who received high doses of ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>5 FEMALE PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Female patients who received high doses of ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8 FOCAL/1 GENERALIZED PHARMACOREsistant EPILEPSY PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy were treated with ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2006-2013<|>HIGH DOSES OF ZNS<|>High doses of ZNS were administered between 2006 and 2013)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>EPILEPSY<|>Zonisamide is a medication used to treat epilepsy)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>9 PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Patients who received high doses of ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>5 FEMALE PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Female patients who received high doses of ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>34 YEARS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>The average age of the patients was 34 years old)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Complex partial seizures are a type of seizure that can be treated with ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OTHER SEIZURE TYPES<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Other types of seizures can also be treated with ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>5 PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Five patients were still taking high doses of ZNS after 1 year)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>3 PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Three patients had adverse events while on high doses of ZNS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>6 PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Six patients had good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2 PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Two patients had their plasma levels of ZNS measured)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2 PATIENTS<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Plasma levels of ZNS were available for two patients)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>37%<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Adverse events were observed in 37% of the patients)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>66%<|>ZONISAMIDE<|>Good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs was observed in 66% of the patients)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
