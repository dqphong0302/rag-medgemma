A total of 680 eligible cases were classified into three groups (surveillance, opportunistic, and symptomatic groups) according to their initial exposure. We used survival time, tumor morphology, and T staging as prognostic outcomes. The outcomes of screened/unscreened and sur veillance/nonsur veillance were compared with the use of the logistic regression model. The adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival time being used as outcomes, were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.52), 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.53), and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.23-0.61), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for surveillance versus nonsurveillance were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.97), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27-0.74), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.73). The odds ratios were even smaller when tumor morphology or T stage was taken as the main outcome. All these results were statistically significant. There were significant gradient relationships between prognostic outcomes and extent of screening history.\n\nAnswer: The significant impact of ultrasonographic screening on mortality reduction was demonstrated. These findings strongly suggest that early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound may improve the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>EVENT<|>Type of cancer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ULTRASONOGRAPHY<|>GEO<|>Method used for screening)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURVEILLANCE<|>EVENT<|>Screening method)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCREENING<|>EVENT<|>Method used to detect the disease)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONCOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Field of study related to cancer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVAL TIME<|>GEO<|>Outcome measured in relation to the disease)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>T STAGING<|>EVENT<|>Method used for measuring tumor spread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL<|>MODEL<|>Statistical tool used for analysis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ULTRASONOGRAPHY<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>Ultrasound is a method used to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVEILLANCE<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>Surveillance is a screening method for hepatocellular carcinoma<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCREENING<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>Screening is a method used to detect the disease in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVAL TIME<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>Survival time is a measure of how long a patient lives after being diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>T STAGING<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>Tumor staging is a method used to measure the spread of cancer in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>Logistic regression model is a statistical tool used for analyzing survival time and tumor staging data<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVEILLANCE<|>SCREENING<|>Surveillance can be considered as a screening method<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCREENING<|>SURVEILLANCE<|>Screening is a method used to detect the disease in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>SURVIVAL TIME<|>Hepatocellular carcinoma can affect survival time<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA<|>T STAGING<|>Hepatocellular carcinoma can affect tumor staging<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ULTRASONOGRAPHY<|>LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL<|>Ultrasound is a method used to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma and can be analyzed using logistic regression model<|>1)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
