In the setting of acute ascending aortic dissection warranting emergency aortic repair, coronary angiography has been considered to be desirable, if not essential. The benefits of defining coronary anatomy have to be weighed against the risks of additional delay before surgical intervention. Retrospective analysis of patient charts and the Cardiovascular Information Registry (CVIR) at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. We studied 122 patients who underwent emergency surgery of the aorta between January 1982 and December 1997. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 18.0%, and there was no significant difference between those who had coronary angiography on the day of surgery compared with those who had not (No: 16%, n = 81 vs. Yes: 22%, n = 41, p = 0.46). Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of myocardial infarction (MI) was the only predictor of in-hospital mortality (relative risk: 4.98 95% confidence interval: 1.48-16.75, p = 0.009); however, coronary angiography had no impact on in-hospital mortality in patients with a history of MI. Furthermore, coronary angiography did not significantly affect the incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during aortic surgery (17% vs. 25%, Yes vs. No). Operative reports revealed that 74% of all CABG procedures were performed because of coronary dissection, and not coronary artery disease.\n\nAnswer: These data indicate that determination of coronary anatomy may not impact on survival in patients undergoing emergency surgery of the aorta and support the concept that once diagnosed, patients should proceed as quickly as possible to surgery.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONARY ANGIOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>Procedure performed before emergency aortic surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMERGENCY AORTIC SURGERY<|>EVENT<|>Type of surgery performed on the aorta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IN-HOSPITAL MORTALITY<|>EVENT<|>Rate of death after surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AORTA<|>GEO<|>Blood vessel in the chest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION<|>PERSON<|>Heart attack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CABG<|>EVENT<|>Procedure performed to bypass blocked coronary arteries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONARY DISSECTION<|>EVENT<|>Tear in the aorta)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONARY ANGIOLOGY<|>EMERGENCY AORTIC SURGERY<|>Coronary angiography is a procedure performed before emergency aortic surgery<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IN-HOSPITAL MORTALITY<|>EMERGENCY AORTIC SURGERY<|>In-hospital mortality rate is affected by the type of surgery<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONARY ANGIOLOGY<|>CABG<|>Coronary angiography can be used to determine if a patient needs CABG during aortic surgery<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION<|>IN-HOSPITAL MORTALITY<|>A history of MI is a predictor of in-hospital mortality<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CABG<|>CORONARY DISSECTION<|>74% of CABG procedures were performed because of coronary dissection, not coronary artery disease<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMERGENCY AORTIC SURGERY<|>AORTA<|>Emergency aortic surgery is performed on the aorta<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONARY DISSECTION<|>CABG<|>Coronary dissection can lead to CABG during aortic surgery<|>1)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
