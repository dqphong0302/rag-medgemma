A systematic review of longitudinal volumetric studies using region-of-interest structural magnetic resonance imaging in patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects. The percentage change in volume between scans for each brain region of interest was obtained, and data were combined using random effects meta-analysis. Twenty-seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with 928 patients and 867 control subjects, and 32 different brain regions of interest. Subjects with schizophrenia showed significantly greater decreases over time in whole brain volume, whole brain gray matter, frontal gray and white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter volume, as well as larger increases in lateral ventricular volume, than healthy control subjects. The time between baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans ranged from 1 to 10 years. The differences between patients and control subjects in annualized percentage volume change were -.07% for whole brain volume, -.59% for whole brain gray matter, -.32% for frontal white matter, -.32% for parietal white matter, -.39% for temporal white matter, and +.36% for bilateral lateral ventricles.\n\nAnswer: These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHIZOPHRENIA<|>EVENT<|>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal thinking, feeling, and behavior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRUCTURAL BRAIN ABNORMALITIES<|>EVENT<|>Structural brain abnormalities are changes in the physical structure of the brain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLUMETRIC STUDIES<|>EVENT<|>Longitudinal studies that measure brain volume over time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGION-OF-INTEREST STRUCTURAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING<|>GEO<|>Technique used to study brain structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals without schizophrenia who are used as a comparison group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRONTAL GRAY MATTER<|>GEO<|>Part of the brain associated with higher cognitive functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIETAL WHITE MATTER<|>GEO<|>Part of the brain involved in processing sensory information and language)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPORAL WHITE MATTER<|>GEO<|>Part of the brain involved in memory, language, and executive function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLUMETRIC CHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Change in brain volume over time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Lateral Ventricle<|>GEO<|>Fluid-filled cavities within the brain)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHIZOPHRENIA<|>STRUCTURAL BRAIN ABNORMALITIES<|>Schizophrenia is associated with structural brain abnormalities<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLUMETRIC STUDIES<|>HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS<|>Used to compare changes in brain volume between patients and healthy individuals<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHIZOPHRENIA<|>VOLUMETRIC CHANGE<|>Schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS<|>VOLUMETRIC CHANGE<|>Healthy control subjects show no significant changes in brain volume over time<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHIZOPHRENIA<|>MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE<|>Schizophrenia is associated with progressive medial temporal lobe involvement<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLUMETRIC CHANGE<|>MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE<|>Progressive changes in the medial temporal lobe are observed in schizophrenia patients<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHIZOPHRENIA<|>Lateral Ventricle<|>Schizophrenia is associated with increased lateral ventricular volume<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLUMETRIC CHANGE<|>Lateral Ventricle<|>Increased lateral ventricular volume is observed in schizophrenia patients<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS<|>VOLUMETRIC CHANGE<|>Healthy control subjects show no significant changes in brain volume over time<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
