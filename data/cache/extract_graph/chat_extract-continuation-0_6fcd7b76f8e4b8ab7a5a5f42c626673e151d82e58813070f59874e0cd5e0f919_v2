We studied a total of 594 women with BMI data from clinic visits at years (Y) 1, 5, 10, and 15. Knee pain at Y15 was assessed by questionnaire. Associations between BMI over 14 years and knee pain at Y15 were examined using logistic regression. BMI significantly increased from Y1 to Y15 (P<0.0005) with medians (interquartile ranges) of 24.5 kg/m(2)  (22.5-27.2 kg/m(2) ) and 26.5 kg/m(2)  (23.9-30.1 kg/m(2) ), respectively. At Y15, 45.1% of subjects had knee pain. A greater BMI at Y1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]1.05-1.69), at Y15 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.61), and change in BMI over 15 years (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.93) were significant predictors of knee pain at Y15 (P<0.05). BMI change was associated with bilateral (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.05-1.76, P = 0.024) but not unilateral knee pain (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73-1.76, P = 0.298). The association between BMI change and knee pain was independent of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). The strength of association between BMI and knee pain at Y15 was similar during followup measurements.\n\nAnswer: Over 14 years, a higher BMI predicts knee pain at Y15 in women, independently of radiographic knee OA. When adjusted, the association was significant in bilateral, not unilateral, knee pain, suggesting alternative pathologic mechanisms may exist. The longitudinal effect of BMI on knee pain at Y15 is equally important at any time point, which may assist reducing the population burden of knee pain.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHINGFORD STUDY<|>EVENT<|>Study examining long-term effects of BMI on knee pain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BMI<|>GEO<|>Body Mass Index)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Knee Pain<|>EVENT<|>Pain in the knees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>594 WOMEN<|>PERSON<|>Women who participated in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAR 1<|>EVENT<|>Year of initial BMI measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAR 5<|>EVENT<|>Year of second BMI measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAR 10<|>EVENT<|>Year of third BMI measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAR 15<|>EVENT<|>Year of fourth BMI measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Knee Pain Questionnaire<|>EVENT<|>Questionnaire used to assess knee pain at Y15)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Logistic Regression<|>EVENT<|>Statistical method used to analyze the relationship between BMI and knee pain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis (OA)<|>GEO<|>Osteoarthritis of the knee as assessed by radiographs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OR<|>Odds Ratio)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>95% CI<|>Confidence Interval)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI<|>CHINGFORD STUDY<|>BMI was measured in the Chingford Study<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI<|>Knee Pain Questionnaire<|>BMI is associated with knee pain as assessed by questionnaire<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI<|>Radiographic Knee OA<|>BMI is not a predictor of knee pain if radiographic OA is present<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI<|>Knee Pain at Y15<|>BMI is associated with knee pain at Y15<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Knee Pain at Y15<|>BMI change is a predictor of knee pain at Y15<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Knee Pain at Y15<|>BMI change is associated with knee pain at Y15<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Bilateral Knee Pain<|>BMI change is associated with bilateral knee pain<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Unilateral Knee Pain<|>BMI change is not associated with unilateral knee pain<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Knee Pain at Y15<|>BMI change is a predictor of knee pain at Y15<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Radiographic Knee OA<|>BMI change is not associated with radiographic knee OA<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Knee Pain at Y15<|>BMI change is a predictor of knee pain at Y15<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Bilateral Knee Pain<|>BMI change is associated with bilateral knee pain<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BMI Change<|>Unilateral Knee Pain<|>BMI change is not associated with unilateral knee pain<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
