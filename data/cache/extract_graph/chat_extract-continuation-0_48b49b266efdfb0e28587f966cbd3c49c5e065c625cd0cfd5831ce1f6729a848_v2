The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications. Patients receiving UH vs. FH differed in several characteristics including laboratory values and anticoagulation indications.\n\nAnswer: Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA PATIENT<|>PERSON<|>A patient who has suffered trauma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THERAPEUTIC ANOCULATION<|>EVENT<|>Treatment of a patient with bleeding after trauma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN<|>CHEMICAL<|>Anticoagulant medication used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRACTIONATED HEPARIN<|>CHEMICAL<|>Anticoagulant medication used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS<|>EVENT<|>A condition that can occur after trauma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOOD TRANSFUSION<|>EVENT<|>Procedure to replace lost blood due to bleeding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE<|>PERSON<|>A condition that can increase the risk of complications from anticoagulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION<|>EVENT<|>A measure of red blood cell count)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING<|>EVENT<|>A medical condition where there is excessive loss of blood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEATH<|>EVENT<|>Loss of life due to a variety of causes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA PATIENT<|>THERAPEUTIC ANOCULATION<|>Trauma patients are treated with anticoagulation therapy for bleeding after trauma<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA PATIENT<|>BLOOD TRANSFUSION<|>Patients who require blood transfusions due to bleeding from trauma<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE<|>THERAPEUTIC ANOCULATION<|>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can increase the risk of complications from anticoagulation<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN<|>THERAPEUTIC ANOCULATION<|>Unfractionated heparin is a medication used in the study for anticoagulation<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRACTIONATED HEPARIN<|>THERAPEUTIC ANOCULATION<|>Fractionated heparin is a medication used in the study for anticoagulation<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA PATIENT<|>DEATH<|>Trauma patients can experience death due to complications from bleeding or other causes<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION<|>BLOOD TRANSFUSION<|>Hemoglobin concentration is a measure of red blood cell count and can be affected by blood transfusions<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA PATIENT<|>BLEEDING<|>Trauma patients are at risk for bleeding after trauma<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE<|>DEATH<|>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can increase the risk of death from complications<|>1)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
