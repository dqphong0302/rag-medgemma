This is the rationale behind the \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). Implementation of this policy will lead to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Is the region yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue? The introduction and widespread use of ART have drastically changed the natural history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future. Indeed, ART is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes and overt diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden of disease. Additionally, there is dearth of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, to anticipate on strategies that should be put in place to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan. These are required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden.\n\nAnswer: While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The WHO developed the \"test and treat\" policy for HIV/AIDS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUB- Saharan Africa<|>GEO<|>Region where the \"test and treat\" policy will be implemented)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ART<|>EVENT<|>Antiretroviral therapy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIV/AIDS<|>EVENT<|>Disease that the WHO's \"test and treat\" policy aims to manage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EARLY ART INITIATION<|>EVENT<|>Early initiation of ART is a key component of the \"test and treat\" policy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEART DISEASE<|>EVENT<|>A potential adverse effect of ART)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIPODYSTROPHY<|>EVENT<|>Another potential adverse effect of ART)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREDIabetes<|>EVENT<|>Another potential adverse effect of ART)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVER-T<|>EVENT<|>A condition that can be caused by ART)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INACCESSIBLE HEALTH SERVICES<|>GEO<|>Lack of access to healthcare in SSA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POVERTY<|>GEO<|>High poverty levels in SSA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH SYSTEMS<|>GEO<|>Weak health systems in SSA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH FACILITIES<|>GEO<|>Limited availability of healthcare facilities in SSA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH PERSONNEL<|>GEO<|>Lack of qualified healthcare workers in SSA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDICINES<|>EVENT<|>The need for affordable and accessible medications in SSA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUIPMENT<|>EVENT<|>Lack of adequate medical equipment in SSA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH DATA<|>EVENT<|>Data on ART-related adverse effects is lacking in SSA)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ART<|>WHO developed the \"test and treat\" policy for HIV/AIDS)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB- Saharan Africa<|>ART<|>SSA will be first region to experience the benefits of the \"test and treat\" policy)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ART<|>HEART DISEASE<|>ART can lead to heart disease)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ART<|>LIPODYSTROPHY<|>ART can cause lipodystrophy)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ART<|>PREDIabetes<|>ART can increase the risk of prediabetes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ART<|>OVER-T<|>ART can lead to over-treatment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB- Saharan Africa<|>HEALTH SYSTEMS<|>SSA has weak health systems)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB- Saharan Africa<|>HEALTH FACILITIES<|>SSA lacks adequate healthcare facilities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB- Saharan Africa<|>HEALTH PERSONNEL<|>SSA has a shortage of qualified healthcare workers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB- Saharan Africa<|>MEDICINES<|>SSA faces challenges in accessing affordable medications)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB- Saharan Africa<|>EQUIPMENT<|>SSA lacks adequate medical equipment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTH DATA<|>ART-related adverse effects<|>Lack of data on ART-related adverse effects in SSA)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
