The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of preoperative statin therapy in preventing AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 221 patients underwent CABG in our hospital from 2004 to 2007. 14 patients with preoperative AF and 4 patients with concomitant valve surgery were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups to examine the influence of statins: those with preoperative statin therapy (Statin group, n = 77) and those without it (Non-statin group, n = 126). In addition, patients were divided into two groups to determine the independent predictors for postoperative AF: those with postoperative AF (AF group, n = 54) and those without it (Non-AF group, n = 149). Patient data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 26%. Postoperative AF was significantly lower in the Statin group compared with the Non-statin group (16% versus 33%, p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictors of AF development after CABG were preoperative statin therapy (odds ratio [OR]0.327, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.107 to 0.998, p = 0.05) and age (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.116, p = 0.035).\n\nAnswer: Our study indicated that preoperative statin therapy seems to reduce AF development after CABG.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n(\"entity\"<|>CABG<|>EVENT<|>Surgical procedure for coronary artery bypass grafting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATIN GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Patients who received preoperative statins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NON-STAIN GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Patients who did not receive preoperative statins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTOPERATIVE AF<|>EVENT<|>Atrial fibrillation after CABG)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>221<|>PERSON<|>Number of patients in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>14<|>PERSON<|>Patients with pre-existing atrial fibrillation excluded from the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>54<|>PERSON<|>Number of patients who developed postoperative AF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>149<|>PERSON<|>Number of patients without postoperative AF)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATIN GROUP<|>POSTOPERATIVE AF<|>Statin group had a lower incidence of postoperative AF compared to the non-statin group<|>0.8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NON-STAIN GROUP<|>POSTOPERATIVE AF<|>Non-statin group had a higher incidence of postoperative AF compared to the statin group<|>0.2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PREOPERATIVE STATIN THERAPY<|>POSTOPERATIVE AF<|>Preoperative statin therapy was an independent predictor of reduced risk for postoperative AF<|>0.3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGE<|>POSTOPERATIVE AF<|>Age was also a significant predictor of postoperative AF<|>0.1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CABG<|>STATIN GROUP<|>Patients in the statin group underwent CABG<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CABG<|>NON-STAIN GROUP<|>Patients in the non-statin group underwent CABG<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POSTOPERATIVE AF<|>PREOPERATIVE STATIN THERAPY<|>Preoperative statin therapy was a predictor of reduced risk for postoperative AF<|>0.3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGE<|>POSTOPERATIVE AF<|>Age was also a significant predictor of postoperative AF<|>0.1)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
