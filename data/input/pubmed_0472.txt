Question: Is semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in case of insufficient venous material an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia?

Context: The aim of this study was to analyse the results of infragenual arterial revascularisation using semiclosed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in patients with critical leg ischemia and insufficient venous material for a straightforward femorocrural reconstruction. From December 1990 through December 1998 thirty patients were studied (22 males and 8 females; mean age 65 years, range 31-92 years). The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 1-96 months). Cumulative primary patency and limb salvage rates were calculated according to life-table analysis. The cumulative primary patency was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years. The limb salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and at 3 years.

Answer: In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.
