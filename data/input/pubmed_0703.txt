Question: Do viral infections have a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo?

Context: To investigate the role of viral infection in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In this retrospective study, 483 patients with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was performed. With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the viruses studied, compared to the control group.

Answer: BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.
