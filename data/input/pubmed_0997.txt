Question: Is peak concentration needed in therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin?

Context: We analyzed the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of vancomycin to determine the drug exposure parameters that correlate with the efficacy and nephrotoxicity of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and evaluated the need to use peak concentration in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Serum drug concentrations of 31 hospitalized patients treated with vancomycin for methicillin-resistant S. aureus pneumonia were collected. Significant differences in trough concentration (Cmin)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-24)/MIC were observed between the response and non-response groups. Significant differences in Cmin and AUC0-24 were observed between the nephrotoxicity and non-nephrotoxicity groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed high predictive values of Cmin/MIC and AUC0-24/MIC for efficacy and of Cmin and AUC0-24 for safety of vancomycin.

Answer: These results suggest little need to use peak concentration in vancomycin TDM because Cmin/MIC and Cmin are sufficient to predict the efficacy and safety of vancomycin.
