Question: Is minilaparoscopic inguinal hernia repair feasible?

Context: Laparoscopy has rapidly emerged as the preferred surgical approach to a number of different diseases because it allows for a correct diagnosis and proper treatment. It seems to be moving toward the use of mini-instruments (5 mm or less in diameter). The aim of this paper is to illustrate retrospectively the results of an initial experience of minilaparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (miniTAPP) repair of groin hernia defects performed at two institutions. Between February 2000 and December 2003, a total of 303 patients (mean age, 45 years) underwent a miniTAPP procedure: 213 patients (70.2%) were operated on bilaterally and 90 (28.7%) for a unilateral defect, with a total of 516 hernia defects repaired. The primary endpoint was the feasibility rate for miniTAPP. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of mini-TAPP-related complications. No conversions to laparoscopy or an anterior open approach were required. There were no major complications, while minor complications ranged as high as 0.3%.

Answer: While limited by its retrospective design, the present study indicates that the minilaparoscopic approach to groin hernia repair is safe and effective, making miniTAPP a challenging alternative to laparoscopy in the approach to groin hernia repair.
