Question: A model of healing of Los Angeles grades C and D reflux oesophagitis: is there an optimal time of acid suppression for maximal healing?

Context: In patients with Los Angeles (LA) grade C or D oesophagitis, a positive relationship has been established between the duration of intragastric acid suppression and healing.AIM: To determine whether there is an apparent optimal time of intragastric acid suppression for maximal healing of reflux oesophagitis. Post hoc analysis of data from a proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomized study of 134 adult patients treated with esomeprazole (10 or 40 mg od for 4 weeks) for LA grade C or D oesophagitis. A curve was fitted to pooled 24-h intragastric pH (day 5) and endoscopically assessed healing (4 weeks) data using piecewise quadratic logistic regression. Maximal reflux oesophagitis healing rates were achieved when intragastric pH>4 was achieved for approximately 50-70% (12-17 h) of the 24-h period. Acid suppression above this threshold did not yield further increases in healing rates.

Answer: After 4 weeks' acid-suppressive therapy for LA grade C or D oesophagitis, successful healing appears to reach a threshold above which improvements are unlikely to be achieved despite an increase in number of hours with intragastric pH>4.
