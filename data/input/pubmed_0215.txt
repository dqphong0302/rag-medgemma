Question: Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk?

Context: Using polymerase chain reaction techniques, we evaluated the presence of HPV infection in human breast milk collected from 21 HPV-positive and 11 HPV-negative mothers. Of the 32 studied human milk specimens, no 'high-risk' HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 or 58 DNA was detected.

Answer: This preliminary case-control study indicates the absence of mucosal 'high-risk' HPV types in human breast milk.
