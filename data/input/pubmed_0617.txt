Question: Has the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations changed from 2002 to 2007?

Context: This study examined changes in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies by U.S. adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations between 2002 and 2007. The study was a cross-sectional survey.SETTING/ The study was conducted in the United States. The study comprised adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations. Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. The unadjusted and age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Adults with functional limitations that included changing and maintaining body position experienced a significant increase in CAM use between 2002 and 2007 (31.1%-35.0%, p<0.01). The use of deep breathing exercises was the most prevalent CAM therapy in both 2002 and 2007 and increased significantly during this period (from 17.9% to 19.9%, p<0.05). The use of meditation, massage, and yoga also increased significantly from 2002 and 2007 (11.0%-13.5%, p<0.01; 7.0%-10.9%, p<0.0001; and 5.1% to 6.6%, p<0.05, respectively), while the use of the Atkins diet decreased (2.2%- 1.4%, p<0.01).

Answer: Among U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations, the overall increase in CAM use from 2002 to 2007 was significant, particularly among those with changing and maintaining body position limitations.
