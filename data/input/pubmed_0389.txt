Question: Recovery Outcome Measures: Is There a Place for Culture, Attitudes, and Faith?

Context: Utilization of the Recovery Knowledge Inventory (RKI) and Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ) in southeastern Australia raised questions about the RAQ, including links between attitudes, faith, and culture in supporting the recovery journey. These questions are particularly important when considered in the context of people with mental illness who live in secular multicultural societies.

Answer: This paper discusses the cultural appropriateness of the RAQ in Australian settings, and identifies the need to develop rigorous, inclusive recovery outcome measures.
