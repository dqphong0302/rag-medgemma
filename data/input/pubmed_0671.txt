Question: Can mandibular depiction be improved by changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography images?

Context: Multislice helical computed tomography (CT), which can provide detailed 2-D and 3-D reconstructed images, is useful in imaging diagnosis for dental implant treatment. Therefore, in this study, it was performed to clarify the mandibular depiction of double-oblique reconstructed images when changing their thickness. A total of 38 sites in the mandibular molar region were examined using multislice helical CT. The thicknesses of the double-oblique images using multislice helical CT scans were reconstructed in 4 conditions: 0.3 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.6 mm, and 4.1 mm. In double-oblique images, mandibular depiction was evaluated by 5 oral radiologists using a subjective rating score. In the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal, the highest value was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images; however, there was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images.

Answer: We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.
