Question: Does a febrile reaction to platelets predispose recipients to red blood cell alloimmunization?

Context: A variable effect of inflammation on alloimmunization to transfused red blood cells (RBCs) in mice has been recently reported. We investigated whether RBC alloimmunization in humans was affected by transfusion of blood products in temporal proximity to experiencing a febrile transfusion reaction (FTR) to platelets (PLTs), an event predominantly mediated by inflammatory cytokines. Blood bank databases were used to identify patients who experienced an FTR or possible FTR to PLTs from August 2000 to March 2008 (FTR group). The control group of patients received a PLT transfusion on randomly selected dates without experiencing an FTR. The "event" was defined as the PLT transfusion that caused the FTR in the FTR group or the index PLT transfusion in the control group. The number of transfused blood products and their proximity to the event were recorded along with other recipient data. The primary endpoint was the rate of RBC alloimmunization between the two groups. There were 190 recipients in the FTR group and 245 in the control group. Overall, the recipients in the control group were younger and received more blood products on the day of their event and over the subsequent 10 days. The alloimmunization rate among recipients in the FTR group was higher than in the control group (8% vs. 3%, respectively; p = 0.026).

Answer: These preliminary data support our hypothesis that recipient inflammation may affect RBC alloimmunization in humans; however, a more detailed understanding of the pathophysiologic association between inflammation and alloimmunization is required before definitive conclusions can be reached.
