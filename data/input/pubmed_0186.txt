Question: Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children?

Context: Urine samples were examined by wet smear microscopy, incubated in 5% CO(2) for 1-2 days, and species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. schaalii was performed. In 5 of the 29 screened urines, A. schaalii was found only by real-time PCR in quantities equivalent to ≥ 10(4) -10(5) CFU/mL. In addition, A. schaalii was found in quantities equivalent to ≥ 10(6) CFU/mL by both culture and PCR in two children with a urinary tract infection and large numbers of leucocytes in the urine.

Answer: Actinobaculum schaalii is CO(2)-dependent. Therefore, if there are clinical symptoms and/or a negative culture despite the presence of leucocytes in the urine, Gram staining and incubation in 5% CO(2) or species-specific real-time PCR should be performed to identify A. schaalii.
