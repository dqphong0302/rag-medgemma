Question: Can ki-67 play a role in prediction of breast cancer patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy?

Context: Currently the choice of breast cancer therapy is based on prognostic factors. The proliferation marker Ki-67 is used increasingly to determine the method of therapy. The current study analyses the predictive value of Ki-67 in foreseeing breast cancer patients' responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This study includes patients with invasive breast cancer treated between 2008 and 2013. The clinical response was assessed by correlating Ki-67 to histological examination, mammography, and ultrasonography findings. The average Ki-67 value in our patients collectively (n = 77) is 34.9 ± 24.6%. The average Ki-67 value is the highest with 37.4 ± 24.0% in patients with a pCR. The Ki-67 values do not differ significantly among the 3 groups: pCR versus partial pathological response versus stable disease/progress (P = 0.896). However, Ki-67 values of patients with luminal, Her2 enriched, and basal-like cancers differed significantly from each other. Furthermore, within the group of luminal tumors Ki-67 values of patients with versus without pCR also differed significantly.

Answer: Our data shows that the Ki-67 value predicts the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a function of the molecular subtype, reflecting the daily routine concerning Ki-67 and its impressing potential and limitation as a predictive marker for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response.
