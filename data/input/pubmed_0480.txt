Question: Do primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease?

Context: To determine how often primary care physicians prescribe eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). During a 2-year period (1998-2000) we analyzed data concerning patients with PUD or NUD seen by 80 Italian primary care physicians uniformly distributed throughout the country. We classified patients as having a definitive or a presumptive diagnosis on the basis of the completeness of the diagnostic workup and interpreted the prescription of antibiotics for dyspepsia as evidence of attempted eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Consecutive ambulatory patients. The frequency with which predefined groups of patients received eradication therapy. Of 6866 patients, 690 (10%) received eradication therapy. Of 2162 patients with PUD, 596 (27.6%) received eradication therapy; of 4704 patients with NUD, however, only 94 (2%) received this treatment (P =.0001). A total of 341 (37.7%) of 904 PUD patients with a definitive diagnosis were given eradication therapy and 255 (20.3%) of 1258 PUD patients with a presumptive diagnosis were given therapy (P&lt.0001). In NUD patients, 7 of 743 (0.9%) with a definitive diagnosis received eradication therapy, while 87 (2.2%) of 3961 of those with a presumptive diagnosis were given the same therapy (P =.025).

Answer: While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.
