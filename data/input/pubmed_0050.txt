Question: Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer?

Context: One of the sites most frequently invaded by gastric cancer is the mesocolon; however, the UICC does not mention this anatomical site as an adjacent structure involved in gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to characterize and classify mesocolon invasion from gastric cancer. We examined 806 patients who underwent surgery for advanced gastric carcinoma from 1992 to 2007 at the Department of Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Korea. Among these, patients who showed macroscopically direct invasion into the mesocolon were compared to other patients with advanced gastric cancer. The curability, number and extent of nodal metastasis, and the survival of the mesocolon invasion group were significantly worse than these factors in the T3 group. However, the survival of the mesocolon invasion group after curative resection was much better than that of patients who had incurable factors.

Answer: Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.
