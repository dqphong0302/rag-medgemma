Question: Cold knife conization vs. LEEP. Are they the same procedure?

Context: To prospectively evaluate the amount of tissue removed at loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) vs. cold knife conization. Forty consecutive LEEP or cold knife conization specimens were prospectively measured and weighed by a single pathology technician. Diameter, length and weight of the specimens were compared using Student's t test. Mean diameter of cold knife cone specimens was 2.6 vs. 2.2 cm for LEEP (P = .07). Mean length of cold knife cone specimens was 1.5 vs. 1.0 cm for LEEP (P = .001). Mean weight for cold knife cone specimens was 4.4 vs. 2.0 g for LEEP (P = .001).

Answer: In a prospective evaluation, cold knife cone specimens were 50% longer and 100% heavier than LEEP specimens.
