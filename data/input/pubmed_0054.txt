Question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture?

Context: Sternal fractures in childhood are rare. The aim of the study was to investigate the accident mechanism, the detection of radiological and sonographical criteria and consideration of associated injuries. In the period from January 2010 to December 2012 all inpatients and outpatients with sternal fractures were recorded according to the documentation. A total of 4 children aged 5-14 years with a sternal fracture were treated in 2 years, 2 children were hospitalized for pain management and 2 remained in outpatient care.

Answer: Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for visualization of the extent of the dislocation.
