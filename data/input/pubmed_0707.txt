Question: Does preloading with colloids prevent hemodynamic changes when neurosurgical patients are subsequently changed to the seated position?

Context: This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed to determine and compare the usefulness of preloading colloids (Haemaccel) 10 ml/Kg before positioning whether it can prevent hemodynamic changes during seated positioning or not. The authors studied 20 patients by randomly dividing them into 2 groups. The control group was given crystalloid as maintenance and deposit replacement but the study group was given extra colloids 10 ml/Kg 30 minutes before starting general anesthesia. Both groups were monitored and given anesthesia, balanced technique. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) at different time intervals in the sitting position for 30 minutes were recorded. Statistical analysis was done by Student t-test, Chi-square test and ANOVA (p-value<0. 05 considered significant). The results showed that systolic blood pressure at 15, 20, 30 minutes and CVP at 15, 25, 30 minutes after positioning in the study group was maintained significantly compared to the control group and there were no significant changes in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. There were no other complications during the sitting period.

Answer: It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.
