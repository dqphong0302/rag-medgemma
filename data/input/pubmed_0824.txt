Question: Are head and neck specific quality of life measures necessary?

Context: The purpose of this study was to determine whether head and neck-specific health status domains are distinct from those assessed by general measures of quality-of-life (QOL). Cross-sectional study of 55 head and neck cancer patients in tertiary academic center was made. Three head and neck-specific measures,-including the Head&Neck Survey (H&NS); a brief, multi-item test which generates domain scores; and a general health measure,-were administered. The H&NS was highly reliable and more strongly correlated to the specific measures than to the general measure. Eating/swallowing (ES) and speech/communication (SC) were not well correlated with general health domains. Head and neck pain was highly correlated to general bodily pain (0.88, p<.0001). Despite correlations to some general health domains, appearance (AP) was not fully reflected by any other domain.

Answer: Head and neck-specific QOL measures are necessary and should include domains that reflect ES, SC, and AP.
